# Ð¡ommand-line Hangman

This Python program implements a simple command-line version of the classic [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) game. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list (coding terms) and prompts the player to guess the word by suggesting letters or guessing the entire word. The player has 6 attempts represented by the stages of a hangman drawing. If the player fails to guess the word within the allowed number of attempts, they lose the game.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to guess letters or the entire word.
3. The program will inform you if your guess is correct or incorrect and update the hangman's state accordingly.
4. Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
