# Numeral System Calculator

This Python functions convert numbers between different numeral systems. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

The file consists of several functions, each responsible for converting numbers between specific numeral systems:
- bin2dec(num: str) -> int: Converts binary numbers to decimal.
- hex2dec(num: str) -> int: Converts hexadecimal numbers to decimal.
- dec2hex(num: str) -> str: Converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal.
- dec2bin(num: str) -> int: Converts decimal numbers to binary.
- uptonine2dec(num: str, base: int) -> int: Converts numbers from any base from 1 to 9 to decimal.

## How to Use

- Import the `numeral_system_calculator` module into your own Python script and use its functions.
- Alternatively, you can edit calls in the `main()` and run the original Python file directly to execute the conversions.
