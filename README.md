# Python Playground

This repository contains various Python projects that I've created for practicing programming.

## Repository Structure

- Each project resides in its own directory.
- Each project directory contains a README.md file providing a brief description of the project and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in.
2. Read the README.md file for detailed information about the project and how to use it.
3. Examine the project's source code.

## Projects

- [automate-boring-stuff-projects](./automate-boring-stuff-projects): Projects based on the exercises and tasks outlined in the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.
- [python-generation-projects](./python-generation-projects): mini-projects based on assignments from the "Python Generation" web courses.
