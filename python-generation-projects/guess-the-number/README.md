# Guess the Number Game

This Python program generates a random number and asks the user to guess this number. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

This Python program is an interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program prompts the player to enter the maximum natural number that can be guessed (at least 2), generates a random number between 1 and the number entered by the user, and then asks the player to guess this secret number.

## Dependencies
