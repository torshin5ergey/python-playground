# Backup to ZIP

A Python script that backups an entire folder into a ZIP file.
It is inspired by a practice project [Backing Up a Folder into a ZIP File](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter10/#calibre_link-338) from the book [“Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Description

This Python script allows user to create backups of entire directory by compressing it into ZIP files. The script automatically generates a unique filename for each backup by appending the current date and an incrementing suffix, ensuring that no existing backups are overwritten.
