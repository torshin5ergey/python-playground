In a faraway kingdom there lived an ADJECTIVE wizard named NOUN. He dreamed of learn the most complicated spells, but he was constantly mixing up the spells and creating funny effects. One day he needed NOUN to help him deal with the consequences of his latest failure.
He went to the ADJECTIVE store to find the item he needed. There, an ADJECTIVE salesman was waiting for him, offering him a completely useless NOUN. Eventually, the wizard accidentally VERB the salesman and suddenly discovered that the NOUN was exactly what he needed.
With this NOUN in hand, the wizard was able to VERB his mistake. Now he became the most famous NOUN in the kingdom and regularly VERB complex spells without ridiculous consequences.
