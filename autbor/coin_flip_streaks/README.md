# Coin Flip Streaks

This Python program simulates coin flips and analyzes the occurrence of streaks of six heads or six tails in a row. It is inspired by a practice project [Coin Flip Streaks](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/#calibre_link-188) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Description

The program generates a list of 100 random coin flips, where 'H' represents heads and 'T' represents tails. Then it checks the generated list for the presence of a streak (more than 5 consecutive occurrences of the same outcome). 
Prints the chance of encountering a streak of six heads or tails with 10,000 simulations.
