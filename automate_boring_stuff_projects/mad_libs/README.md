# Updatable Multi-Clipboard

This program implements a word game called "Mad Libs" in CLI. Players fill in blanks in a story with various parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, to create humorous or nonsensical stories.
It is inspired by a practice project [Mad Libs](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter9/#calibre_link-321) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.
