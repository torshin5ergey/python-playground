# Fantasy Game Inventory

This Python program manages an inventory system, allowing users to display the current inventory and add new items to it. It is inspired by a practice project [Fantasy Game Inventory](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-205) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Description

The code consists of two main functions:
1. **Display Inventory**: The function display_inventory() prints out the current inventory along with the total number of items.
2. **Add to Inventory**: The function add_to_inventory() adds new items to the inventory and updates their counts accordingly.

## How to use
1. **Initialize Inventory**: Create a dictionary representing the initial inventory with item names as keys and their respective quantities as values.
2. **Add Loot**: If character acquires new items or loot, you can add them to the inventory using the add_to_inventory().
3. **Display Inventory**: Whenever you want to view the current state of your inventory, use the display_inventory().
