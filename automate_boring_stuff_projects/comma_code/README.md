# Comma Code

This Python program converts a list into a string, with items separated by a comma and a space, and 'and' inserted before the last item. It is inspired by a practice [Comma Code](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/#calibre_link-187) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Description

The program takes a list as input and returns a string representation of the list, where each item is separated by a comma and a space. Additionally, 'and' is inserted before the last item in the list. The program is designed to handle any list value passed to it, including empty lists.
