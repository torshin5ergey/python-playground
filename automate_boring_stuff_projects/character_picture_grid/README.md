# Character Picture Grid

This Python program prints the image represented by a character picture grid. It is inspired by a practice project [Character Picture Grid](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/#calibre_link-189) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Description

The program treats the grid as a representation of a picture, where grid[x][y] corresponds to the character at the x- and y-coordinates. The (0, 0) origin is located in the upper-left corner, with x-coordinates increasing to the right and y-coordinates increasing downward.
The grid's content is printed as an image, where each character represents a part of the picture. The program traverses the grid using nested loops to print each row, ensuring the correct sequence of characters.
