# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It is inspired by a practice [A Tic-Tac-Toe Board](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter5/#calibre_link-199) from the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## How To Play

### Game Board

The game board is a 3x3 grid. Each cell on the grid represents a position where players can place their marks (either 'X' or 'O'). The cells are labeled with coordinates as follows:
```
topL|topM|topR
----+----+----
midL|midM|midR
----+----+----
botL|botM|botR
```

### Game Modes

#### One Player (PvE)

In this mode, you play against the computer. You will be assigned the mark 'X', and the computer will use 'O'. The computer makes *random* moves.

#### Two Players (PvP)

In this mode, two players take turns playing against each other. One player uses 'O', and the other uses 'X'.

## Dependencies
