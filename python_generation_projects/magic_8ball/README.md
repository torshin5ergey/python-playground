# The Magic 8 Ball

This Python program simulates a Magic 8 Ball. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

This Python program replicates the functionality of a Magic 8 Ball, providing users with pseudo-randomized responses to their questions. The user is prompted to input their name and question, to which the program generates a response based on a predefined list of possible answers. An animated "thinking" effect is displayed during the response generation. The user has the option to ask additional questions or exit the program.

## Dependencies

Python 3.x
