# Caesar's Cipher

This Python program implements Caesar's cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

This program allows the user to encrypt or decrypt text using [Caesar's cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).
The program prompts the user to choose the language (Russian or English), the direction (encryption or decryption). It supports both Russian and English alphabets.

## Example
```
Choose the language (rus/eng): eng
Enter a shift number (negative if the direction is left): -17
Enter your text: Kf sv, fi efk kf sv, kyrk zj kyv hlvjkzfe!
Encrypted/decrypted text: To be, or not to be, that is the question!
```

## Dependencies
