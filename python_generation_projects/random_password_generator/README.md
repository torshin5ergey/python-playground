# Random Password Generator

This Python program generates random passwords based on user preferences. It is inspired by a practice project from the Python programming course ["Python Generation: Beginner's Course"](https://stepik.org/course/58852/info).

## Description

This Python program allows users to specify the number of passwords to generate, the length of each password, and which character sets to include. The program can include digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as symbols such as !, @, #, etc. Additionally, it provides an option to exclude ambiguous characters like 'i', 'l', '1', '0', 'o', '8', 'B', '3', 'E', 'v', 'u', '!', '[', ']', '{', '}', which can cause confusion.
